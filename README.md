# Simple Badges

Create and award badges to your users manually, or based on what they accomplish.

## Description

Achievements for BuddyPress is fantastic if you want to integrate badges into a BuddyPress-driven social environment. CubePoints works if you want to award points to your users that are redeemable for things. This plugin focuses on a different kind of situation: awarding badges manually by admin approval, and automatically when specific events are triggered -- and to do so as simply as possible.

Simple Badges provides two ways to award badges:

1. manually by an admin granting the badge to a user, and
2. automatically based on a single condition a user meets.

*Note:* Only the manual badges are functional in this alpha release. Automatic badges are coming in the first public release.

Badges can be managed under Tools > Badges, the same way you add and edit posts and pages. Set badge icons by assigning a featured image, and control whether a badge is hidden to users by default or whether the badge is manually or automatically awarded.

Only a handful of automatic badge conditions will be available with the first public release, though the goal is to have an extensible list that any plugin can support and add conditions for. More on this, along with documentation for it, real soon!

## Kudos

Thanks to Andrew Norcross and his (Quick Vote)[https://github.com/norcross/quick-vote] plugin for inspiring me to dive in and improve my plugin coding standards a bit. 

## Installation

Install the plugin via the browser based installer or by uploading the folder to your plugins directory via FTP.

Once installed, you will be able to edit the badges under Tools > Badges. When created (and after visiting and re-saving your permalinks under Settings > Permalinks) you can view a rundown of your badges at yoursite.com/badges. It's up to you to style and format the display of the badges the way you want them -- expect more instruction and examples on this specific area after public release.

Badges, once awarded, will display on author archive pages (that's the URL typically linked up when you click an author's name in their post byline).
